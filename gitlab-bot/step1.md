Hello!

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a bot for Gitlabs. 

This tutorial runs compleatly inside katacoda (including a Gitlab instance) and because of this it can sometimes (depending on load) be a bit slugish. A little patiance can be required.

It is compleatly possible to perform the steps of this tutorial on your own machine. Using a MacOS, linux or WSL with docker and node installed. If you press `SHOW SOLUTION` there are some extra notes for if you would like to follow this tutorial on your local machine.
