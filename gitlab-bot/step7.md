Try opening this link: [GitLab](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/)

You should be greated by this page.

If you see this try loging in using the following credentials:

Username: `root`
Password: `password`

If you get error `422` then try to reopen the link in a new tab and try again.

If you do not see the login page press `SHOW SOLUTION` below for troubleshooting help.
